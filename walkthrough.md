# OBEAG App Walkthrough

## Overview
I have implemented the core features and authentication for the OBEAG app.

## Features Implemented
1.  **Authentication**:
    -   **Registration**: Users can register using a unique code generated by the admin.
    -   **Login**: Secure login with email and password.
    -   **Middleware**: Protected routes for Dashboard (User) and Admin areas.

2.  **Core Features**:
    -   **Dues Management (Admin)**: Create and list dues (Monthly/Occasional).
    -   **User Dashboard**: View upcoming dues and payment summary (placeholder for now).
    -   **API**: GET /api/dues and POST /api/dues.

## How to Verify

### 1. Database Setup
Ensure your database is set up and migrations are applied:
`ash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
`

### 2. Generate a Registration Code
Since there is no UI for this yet, use the temporary API route:
`ash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/generate-code
`
Copy the code from the response.

### 3. Register a User
1.  Navigate to /register.
2.  Fill in Name, Email, Password, and the **Code** you generated.
3.  Submit. You should be redirected to /login.

### 4. Login
1.  Log in with the created credentials.
2.  You should land on the **Dashboard**.

### 5. Admin Access (Manual Setup Required)
To test the Admin Dashboard, you need to manually promote your user to ADMIN in the database, as there is no UI for this yet.
You can use Prisma Studio:
`ash
npx prisma studio
`
Edit your user and set ole to ADMIN.

### 6. Manage Dues
1.  Navigate to /admin/dues.
2.  Create a new Due.
3.  Verify it appears in the list below.
4.  Go back to / (User Dashboard) and verify the due appears there too.

## Next Steps
-   Implement **Payment Tracking** (Marking dues as paid).
-   Implement **Notifications/Broadcasts**.
-   Add **Email Reminders**.
